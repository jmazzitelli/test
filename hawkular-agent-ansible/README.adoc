* To configure:

1. *hosts*: lists all the hosts where you want to put your WildFly Servers or where your WildFly Servers are
2. *group_vars/wildfly-servers/main.yml*: configure the location of the WildFly Servers and credentials and other things

* To install a WildFly application server that is monitored by a Hawkular WildFly Agent:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts install-wildfly-with-hawkular-wildfly-agent.yml
```

* To start a WildFly application server:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts start-wildfly.yml
```

NOTE: If you are running multiple WildFly application servers on the same machine, you can either change the _wildfly_bind_address_ variable or increase the _wildfly_port_offset_ variable (both defined in the _group_vars/wildfly-servers/main.yml_ file or pass on the ansible-playbook command line via _--extra-vars "name=value"_)

* To stop a WildFly application server:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts stop-wildfly.yml
```
